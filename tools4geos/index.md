# tools4geos
Here I (sporadically) maintain a compilation of links to various geoscience resouces that might be useful. Some resources are just links to pre-existing compilations, while others are new things I discover to which I want to keep a reference handy.


### Compilations
- [tools for petrologists](https://www.kaylaiacovino.com/tools-for-petrologists/), compiled by K. Iacovino
- [MinPet links](https://www.whitman.edu/geology/winter/MinPetLinks.htm), compiled by J. Winter
- [geologic software](https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~sainieid/software/), compiled by B. Sainie-Eidukat <span style="color:red"><<unmaintained>></span>
- [petrology web resources](https://muse.union.edu/hollochk/kurt-hollocher/petrology/web-resources-in-petrology-and-geochemistry/), compiled by K. Hollocher
