# About
I am -- in order of decreasing skillfulness -- a dog dad, partner, geoscientist 
and, among other things, an aspiring coder.


Here, I hope to organize a central repository for all things me: code snippets 
as I "learn in public, daily;" science output; etc. Where I've benefitted from 
the knowledge of others, expect citing links as appropriate. Speaking of which, 
the idea for organizing my page like this comes from various places, including 
[Karl Broman's simple site](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site); 
[Chad Baldwin's simple site](https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap/); 
[Josh Branchaud's TIL](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/)
.
