# About
I am -- in order of decreasing skillfulness -- a dog dad, partner, geoscientist 
and, among other things, an aspiring coder.


Here, I hope to organize a central repository for all things me: code snippets, 
science output, etc. You can navigate via the menu items above.


Everywhere that I've benefitted from the knowledge of others, expect 
citing links as appropriate. Speaking of which, inspiration & help for this 
page comes from various places, including:
- [Karl Broman's simple site](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site); 
- [Chad Baldwin's simple site](https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap/); 
- [Josh Branchaud's TIL](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/)
.
