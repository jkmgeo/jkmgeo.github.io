# About
I am -- in order of decreasing skillfulness -- a dog dad, partner, geoscientist 
and, among other things, an aspiring coder.


Here, I hope to organize a central repository for all things me: code snippets, 
science output, etc. Where I've benefitted from the knowledge of others, expect 
citing links as appropriate. Speaking of which, inspiration & help for this 
page comes from various places, including:
- [Karl Broman's simple site](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site); 
- [Chad Baldwin's simple site](https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap/); 
- [Josh Branchaud's TIL](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/)
.
